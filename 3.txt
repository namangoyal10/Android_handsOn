git github

cls to clear
cd  -- open a directory

cd ../ and cd ../../ go back to prev directory
or also use cd.. works the same



dir --- display contents of current directory

mkdir and_file--- make new directory / folder named and_file

echo.> helllo.java  ===== creates a new java file (can also be used to create .txt)

del hell.java  ====== only deletes files of .java or .txt or commonly used extensions

rmdir  and_file ====delete and_file (rmdir  remove directory works only if the directory is empty .) 

mkdir android_gyan\music makes new directory in android_gyan folder or also called as subdirectory

mkdir android_gyan a\b\c ==makes a new dir a then a new dir b and then a new dr c (this doesnt work for echo)

echo.>android_gyan\a\b\c\hello.txt (a b c should be made already  inside the android gyan)
copy android gyan\a\b\c\hello.txt
